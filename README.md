## 🎯 Business Objective

Retailers collect customer transaction data but often lack the tools to turn this into actionable insights.

This project helps answer:
- What products are most popular and profitable?
- How do demographics influence purchasing behavior?
- Do promotions and subscriptions affect revenue?
- Who are the most loyal or frequent customers?

✅ **Outcome**: Drive product planning, discount strategy, customer segmentation, and marketing decisions.
