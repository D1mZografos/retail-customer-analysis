# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Trends - Data Analytics Project

## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior based on a dataset of 3,900 retail transactions. The data includes demographic details, product purchases, review ratings, payment methods, seasonal preferences, and more. The goal is to use **SQL** and **Power BI** to extract insights that support better business decisions in the retail sector.

## 🎯 Business Objective

Retailers collect customer transaction data but often lack the tools to turn this into actionable insights.

This project helps answer:
- What products are most popular and profitable?
- How do demographics influence purchasing behavior?
- Do promotions and subscriptions affect revenue?
- Who are the most loyal or frequent customers?

✅ **Outcome**: Drive product planning, discount strategy, customer segmentation, and marketing decisions.
